#  Decision tree model to predict survival
The decision tree model is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. In the Titanic dataset, we can predict the survival of passengers using the decision tree algorithm. The decision tree model uses various features such as age, sex, ticket class, and Fare to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

##  Workflow
    - Importing 'titanic.csv' dataset
    - Droping unnecesary columns 
    - Setting input and target 
    - Label Encoding
    - Importing Decision tree and fitting 
    - Finding Model Accuracy Score
    - Prediction 
    
    
## Dataset
dataset - https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/ML/9_decision_tree/Exercise/titanic.csv
 - Dataset consist of titanic ship passengers
 - 891 rows Ã— 12 columns


## Conclusion
Decision tree model on the Titanic dataset, we were able to predict the survival of passengers with an accuracy of 97%. The model was able to correctly predict if passenger survived or did not survive.
Overall, the decision tree model was able to accurately predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic and provide insights into the most important features for survival. The model could be further improved by incorporating additional features and using more advanced techniques, such as ensemble methods, to improve accuracy.
